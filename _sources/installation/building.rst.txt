Building the NWChemEx Package
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile NWChemEx, some packages must be available on your system beforehand:

#. A C++ compiler supporting the C++17 standard, currently we use gcc 9 (10.2
   on Intel), clang has not been fully tested
#. CMake (>= 3.17), usually the latest version is the best to use, be aware
   that some Linux distributions (Ubuntu for example) are often behind on
   CMake versions in the default build
#. BLAS/LAPACK/ScaLAPACK or standards equivalent libraries, partially tested
   options include OpenBlas, NetLib, Blis, FLAME, MKL
#. Boost, currently 1.59 as a minimum; note that bleeding edge Boost often
   requires bleeding edge compilers, so be careful here
#. MPI, most of the code requires at least MPI-3 compliance, MPICH 3.4 has
   been tested
#. Eigen, minimum of 3.4.0; the build will automatically pull this if you
   don't have it available
#. libint2 - see below for more information
#. Depending on what type of GPU you have available to you, you will need CUDA
   11 or higher, SYCL 2.0 (use the latest version of the OneAPI SDK), or HIP
   4.5 (use the latest ROCm version)

If necessary, more installation details for a package will be provided in the
subsections below.

NWChemEx also depends on a number of repositories listed below. Please visit
the repositories and ensure that any additional packages that must be available
before building are installed.

#. `integrals <https://github.com/NWChemEx/Integrals>`__
#. `SCF <https://github.com/NWChemEx/SCF>`__
#. `MP2 <https://github.com/NWChemEx/MP2>`__

BLAS/LAPACK/ScaLAPACK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Intel MKL (Intel oneAPI MKL):** Ensure that all required environment
variables for the Intel MKL are set by executing ``/path/to/intel/mkl/bin/
mklvars.sh <arch>``, where ``<arch>`` must be either ``ia32`` or ``intel64``.
The following command can be added to your ``.bashrc`` to set the required
environment variables automatically for all new terminal sessions:

.. code-block:: bash

   . /path/to/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh <arch>

**Other BLAS/LAPACK/ScaLAPACK:** If not using the Intel MKL, ensure that
environment variables for the packages are set up correctly according to the
package-specific instructions and that paths to non-standard installation
directories are included in the cmake variable ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` (which
should be specified in your ``toolchain.cmake`` file (see below)).

libint2
^^^^^^^
.. note::
   **Important:** Boost must be installed and in your path prior to building
   libint2. This is not required by libint2, as libint2 will use its own
   internal build of Boost. However, when building NWChemEx, errors related
   to using this internal build of Boost have been observed (by Zach Crandall
   as of April 29, 2021).

The libint2 build will take a long time (probably >2 hrs), and should be
started well in advance. At the time of writing, libint v2.6.0 can be obtained
from the `libint v2.6.0 release <https://github.com/evaleev/libint/releases/
tag/v2.6.0>`__ page and built using instructions at `libint Wiki
<https://github.com/evaleev/libint/wiki>`__ if a custom library is needed.

The following build script can be used to build and install the libint2
pre-generated library "lmax=6 library (standard ints only)", which can be
downloaded from the
`libint v2.6.0 release <https://github.com/evaleev/libint/releases/tag/
v2.6.0>`__ page or directly from `here <https://github.com/evaleev/libint/
releases/download/v2.6.0/libint-2.6.0.tgz>`__. Download and extract the
pre-generated libint v2.6.0 library. Inside the newly extracted libint-2.6.0
directory, create a file named ``build.sh`` and paste the below contents,
modifying everything in angled brackets (<>) to be correct for your system.

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   cmake -H . \
         -B build \
	 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<desired_install_location> \
	 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<c++_compiler> \
	 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3" \
	 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11 \
	 -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=TRUE \
	 2>&1 | tee OUTPUT.GEN

   cmake --build build --target install 2>&1 | tee OUTPUT.BUILD

GitHub Personal Access Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is necessary since, at the moment,
NWChemEx and some dependencies are hosted in private repositories. To create a
PAT, follow the instructions at GitHub's `Creating a personal access token
<https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/
creating-a-personal-access-token>`_ page. Note: please create a **classical
personal access token**, not a fine-grained personal access token. This PAT
will be used when prompted for a password while cloning repositories.


Building NWChemEx
-----------------

The build instructions are given in the following sections based on a few
assumptions:

#. You are using a sane Unix-like operating system.
#. All components will be installed in the same location.

The following two files will be created to build NWChemEx, with instructions
for each in the sections below:

#. CMake Toolchain File: ``toolchain.cmake``
#. NWChemEx Build Script: ``build_nwx.sh``

CMake Toolchain File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NWChemEx requires knowledge of many packages and tools which may have system-
specific installation locations. Inside the top level directory where NWChemEx
will be built, create a toolchain file named ``toolchain.cmake``. This file
should contain the following information, replacing everything in angled
brackets (<>) for your system.

.. code-block:: cmake

   # Compilers
   set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   <C compiler>)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <C++ compiler>)
   set(MPI_C_COMPILER     <MPI C compiler>)
   set(MPI_CXX_COMPILER   <MPI CXX compiler>)

   # Token for private repos
   set(CMAIZE_GITHUB_TOKEN <your_super_secret_github_PAT>)

   # Options
   set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)
   set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS TRUE)
   set(BUILD_TESTING TRUE)

   # List directories for dependencies you have installed in non-standard
   # locations. For example:
   # set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   #     /path/to/libint2_install
   #     /path/to/personal/BLAS/install
   #     ...
   # )
   # Uncomment the lines above and set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH specifically in
   # your case.

   list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <additional_prefix_directories>)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

   # BLAS/LAPACK
   set(ENABLE_SCALAPACK ON)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -DOMPI_SKIP_MPICXX")


NWChemEx Build Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a new file named ``build_nwx.sh`` next to ``toolchain.cmake`` and paste
the script below into it. This script will download, build, and install NWChemEx
and any remaining dependencies. Logs for the build will be generated beside this
build script.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/NWChemEx/NWChemEx.git 2>&1 | tee "OUTPUT.GITCLONE"
   # <Type login information if prompted.>

   # Navigate into the newly created NWChemEx subdirectory
   cd NWChemEx

   # Generate project buildsystem
   cmake -H. \
         -Bbuild \
         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`pwd`/../toolchain.cmake \
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where/you/want/to/install> \
         2>&1 | tee "../OUTPUT.GEN"

   # Build the project. You can change the "1" to another integer,
   # N, to instead build with N threads
   cmake --build build -- -j 1 \
         2>&1 | tee "../OUTPUT.BUILD"

   # Run tests
   cd build && ctest 2>&1 | tee "../../OUTPUT.TEST"

   # Back out of the build directory
   cd ..

   # Install the project
   cmake --build build --target install 2>&1 | tee "../OUTPUT.INSTALL"

   # Return to the top level directory
   cd ..

``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` is currently set to ``"Debug"``, because a ``Release``
build may take an extremely long time to finish (a known issue to be resolved).

The toolchain.cmake file and the building script for NWChemEx can also be used
(with minor modifications such as repo paths) to compile other packages in the
NWChemEx project.

Running the NWChemEx Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming NWChemEx is built with ``BUILD_TESTING`` enabled, then once the NWChemEx package is successfully built the unit tests can be run by running  ``ctest`` in the build directory. For debugging purposes, the log files resulting from running the unit tests can be found in the ``Testing/Temporary``
subdirectory of the build directory.

.. note::

   For finer-grained control over the build, we direct the reader to the more
   thorough CMaize build instructions located `here
   <https://cmakepackagingproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_
   and note that NWChemEx depends on several other projects:

   * `Catch2 <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`_ (for testing only)
