This is the homepage for the NWChemEx software package. NWChemEx sits at the
core of the broader NWChemEx Community. If you are new to NWChemEx and the
NWChemEx community we recommend starting with the short introduction over on
the NWChemEx Community's website.

.. note::

   TODO: Add link to the short introduction (and write it)

At the core of the NWChemEx Community is NWChemEx, a high-performance, modular,
quantum chemistry software package.

The https://github.com/NWChemEx/NWChemEx is the top-level, user-centric
repository for the NWChemEx project. The documentation you are currently reading
is the top-most documentation page associated with the NWChemEx project. We have
attempted to (and continue to attempt to) provide comprehensive documentation of
the project, its APIs, and its use cases. If you are new to the project check
out the getting started (TODO: add link) page to orient yourself. Otherwise use
the table of contents below to help jump to the topic of interest.
