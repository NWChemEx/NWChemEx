Getting Started with NWChemEx
*****************************

Superficially the NWChemEx documentation is split into three types of
documentation, depending on the role you occupy while interacting with NWChemEx:
an end-user, a collaborator, or a developer. The roles are not exclusive,
**e.g.**, most developers will be end-users at some point. Nonetheless, start by
asking yourself: "How do I plan to use NWChemEx?"

If you answered along the lines of:

#. "I want to run a computational chemistry calculation."

   - Congratulations!!! You are an end-user.

#. "I want to interface my existing code with NWChemEx."

   -  Awesome!!! You are a collaborator.

#. "I want to contribute source code directly to NWChemEx."

   - Welcome to the team!!! You are a developer.
   - A link to the developer documentation can be found
     `here <https://nwchemex.github.io/DeveloperTools/>`_
   - The developer documentation is hosted out of the DeveloperTools repo. The
     documentation references scripts and other tools located in that repo.

#. "I want to do something else."

   - Either NWChemEx is not the project for you or we missed a scenario. Feel
     free to contact us using
