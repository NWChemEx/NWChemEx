Collaborator Documentation
##########################

In the context of NWChemEx, collaborators are developers who have existing
source code, which does not use NWChemEx's infrastructure, **i.e.**, the code
does not use the SDE, LibChemist, or PropertyTypes. The topics in this part
are targeted at collaborators.
