Advanced PluginPlay Primer
***************************

The PluginPlay library actually has a lot more functionality than what was
showcased in the :ref:`pluginplay_primer`. To take maximum advantage
of this functionality it is recommended you read through the SimDE
`tutorials <https://nwchemex.github.io/PluginPlay/tutorials/index.html>`_ and/or
`documentation <https://nwchemex.github.io/PluginPlay/developer/index.html>`_.
On this page we briefly highlight some of the additional functionality that is
most likely to be of interest to collaborators. This is not intended to be
exhaustive or comprehensive.

Additional Parameters
---------------------

Quite often the inputs from the property type are not the only inputs your
module needs.
