Running NWChemEx
================

Although could be made possible, NWChemEx usually does not run in the same
way as other conventional quantum chemistry packages do: obtaining all
calculation settings from a text input file. To increase the flexibility of
setting calculation routes and facilitate post-processing of calculation
results, we recommend running NWChemEx with Python scripts. Once the NWChemEx
package is successfully compiled, the python bindings of all the C++ modules
are generated with the tool
`cppyy <https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
An example of running an SCF calculation with the Python bindings can be
found in ``NWChemEx/tests/test_python.py``. We encourage our users to write
their own python scripts for the special needs in their calculations.
